div tag is a nonsymentic tag because we cant not identify by seeing this tag what does it do. 
this tag only contain a block of code. mainlt it contain other tags content.

it is a block of elements 
which means it takes the whole width of the web page either it is a single word or huge it takes the whole width. 

the oposite of the block elements is inline elements

which take as much width as it need

like span tag

there are lots of inline and block elements tag.
