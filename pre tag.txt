<pre>: (Preformatted text)
    Usally html doesn't count extra tag between word. Even if, we use more than one spaces in our writting the html will count only one spaces. So, there might be a problem if we show our webpage more than one spaces. In that case we can use Preformatted text <pre>some text</pre>
    
    <pre>It is Preformatted tag which will count your extra spaces pre_tag</pre>
