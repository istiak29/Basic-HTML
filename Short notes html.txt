Basic Html file Structure:
<html>

<head>
</head>

<body>
</body>

</html>

Every html file starts with the <html> tag and after all of your code is done then you have to close the tag. You have to do all sorts of coding inside the html tag. The html tag has two different parts one is the head part and another one is the body part. Inside the Head tag, you have to mention the details of the web page that you are going to create like, the title and extra information, then you have to close the head tag and start the body tag. Inside the body tag, you do your desired coding. Whatever you want to do, you have to do inside the body tag. Remember the html tag is used for your entire code but the body tag contains the main contents coding like you might add audio, video, photos, etc. After all of your coding, you have to close the body tag and then close the html tag. 

For comments, you have to use a particular tag that is <!--   --> and inside this whatever you want you can write.
Document type declaration: 
If you do not mention the document type then you might fall into some trouble because the Document type reveals the version type. In which version you are writing the code it should be mentioned. At present we will use HTML5 which means we are using version 5. For this version, before you write some code you should mention <!DOCTYPE html > but remember this is not a tag. 
For a website title you have to use <title></title> tag. Inside this tag, we mention the website’s title and you can see it in the address bar of your browser. 

HTML Element:
When we use a tag completely then we can say the whole tag as an Element. For example, if we use the p tag completely it will look like 
<p> I am Istiak Islam</p> 
So, it is a complete p tag and we can say this is an element. So, the element contains the whole parts of a tag. Now we can define a common structure for an element that is, the element will start with the opening tag and it must be finished with the closing tag. Then, inside the open and closing tag there should be some content along with the attributes. The empty element should be closed inside the opening tag like <br/> or <hr/> etc. 
<html>, <head>, <title> and <body> are the main elements. 
<html> :
